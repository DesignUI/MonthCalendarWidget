Simple calendar widget for Android, showing one month at a time.

This is a Yahoo Widget's Calendar clone (http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/calendar). It just shows one month at a time, letting you navigate to the previous and next months (there is no connection to any calendar application, like Google Calendar).
